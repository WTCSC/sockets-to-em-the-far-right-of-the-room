A dramatic slow clap
A suspiciously specific amount of glitter
My search history
A raccoon with attitude
A potato with WiFi
The neighbor's WiFi
An expired coupon
A motivational poster
A very confused pigeon
A questionable life choice

A dramatic eye roll
An overpowered stapler
A single sock
A glitter explosion
A keyboard covered in crumbs
A mildly cursed sandwich
A rubber duck army
A slow internet connection
An unexpected plot twist
A dancing llama
A fake mustache
An outdated meme
A dramatic hair flip
An invisible friend
A talking houseplant
A sarcastic robot
A broken pencil

A dramatic monologue
A tiny violin
A badly timed joke
A confused GPS
An aggressive alarm clock
